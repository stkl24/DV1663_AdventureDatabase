# DV1663_AdventureDatabase
A database project for course DV1663: a short adventure game using MySQL database interaction with Python. 

Use the dump files from folder: dnd_campaign_dump and import the schema in MySQL.  
The schema name is: dnd_campaign  
All functionality should be stored in the dump files. (Hopefully)  

All queries used to create the database, tables, inserting data etc. are all stored in a file.   
See file: queries_dnd_database.sql  

To try the Python program, you need to have setup the database correctly.  
Then, insert your login credentials in the function main() of the Pyhton code. (See comments in the code).  
NOTE: code does not currently have any proper error handling, so if it does not work...OOPS!
